            <h4>Leo</h4>
            <p>Leo is a friendly and playful boy who loves attention. 
                He's very curious and enjoys exploring his surroundings. 
                He's also quite affectionate and will often come to you for cuddles and head scratches.  
                He can be a little vocal when he wants something (usually food!). 
                He gets along well with other cats but hasn't been tested with dogs or children.</p>

            <h4>Luna</h4>
            <p>Luna is a sweet and energetic girl who loves to play fetch and go for walks. 
                She's very friendly and affectionate, and enjoys cuddling on the couch. 
                She's eager to please and learns quickly, making her a great candidate for training.  
                She can be a little nervous in new situations, but warms up quickly with gentle reassurance. 
                She's good with other dogs her size, but her interactions with cats are unknown.  
                She's very enthusiastic and can sometimes be a bit jumpy, so a home with older children or adults would be best.</p>

            <h4>Jasper</h4>
            <p>Jasper is a playful and curious kitten with a lot of energy. 
                He loves chasing toys, batting at dangling objects, and exploring every nook and cranny.
                He's also very affectionate and enjoys cuddling up on laps and purring contentedly.
                While he's friendly with people, he can be a little skittish around loud noises or sudden movements, 
                so a calm and patient home would be ideal. He gets along well with other gentle cats but hasn't been introduced to dogs.</p>
